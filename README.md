## üß™ Experimental Features

Streamyfin includes some exciting experimental features like media downloading and Chromecast support. These are still in development, and we appreciate your patience and feedback as we work to improve them.

### Downloading

Downloading works by using ffmpeg to convert an HLS stream into a video file on the device. This means that you can download and view any file you can stream! The file is converted by Jellyfin on the server in real time as it is downloaded. This means a **bit longer download times** but supports any file that your server can transcode.

### Chromecast

Chromecast support is still in development, and we're working on improving it. Currently, it supports casting videos and audio, but we're working on adding support for subtitles and other features.

### Streamyfin Plugin

The Jellyfin Plugin for Streamyfin is a plugin you install into Jellyfin that hold all settings for the client Streamyfin. This allows you to syncronize settings accross all your users, like:

- Auto log in to Jellyseerr without the user having to do anythin
- Choose the default languages
- Set download method and search provider
- Customize homescreen
- And more...

### Beta testing

To access the Streamyfin beta, you need to subscribe to the Member tier (or higher) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/streamyfin). This will give you immediate access to the ‚Å†üß™-public-beta channel on Discord and i'll know that you have subscribed. This is where I post APKs and IPAs. This won't give automatic access to the TestFlight, however, so you need to send me a DM with the email you use for Apple so that i can manually add you.

**Note**: Everyone who is actively contributing to the source code of Streamyfin will have automatic access to the betas.

## üöÄ Getting Started
